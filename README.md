# Learn Material Fonts and Symbols

Material's Learning Fonts and Symbols Demo helps designers experiment with a range of new design resources: two variable fonts (Roboto Flex & Roboto Serif), and Material Symbols, a variable icons system.

The demo will features 8 slides, which run through the five axes of the Variable fonts and symbols, and links out to resources for the three new launches themselves.
